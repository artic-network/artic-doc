## Overview

It is designed to help automate the ARTIC bioinformatics protocols; for example the MEV protocol.

## Features include:

- read filtering
- primer trimming
- amplicon coverage normalisation
- variant calling
- consensus building
- QC report generation

## Using amplicon-nf

We have produced a detailed SOP for running the pipeline using the EPI2MElabs desktop client which is [available here](/resources/amplicon-nf/amplicon-nf-epi2me-sop.html).

Once you have successfully run the pipeline you may wish to check our guide which  [available here](/resources/amplicon-nf/amplicon-nf-epi2me-outputs-guide.html)
