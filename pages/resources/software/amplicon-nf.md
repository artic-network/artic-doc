## Overview
amplicon-nf is a bioinformatics pipeline that takes sequencing reads generated from ARTIC-style viral amplicon sequencing schemes, assembles them into consensus sequences, and runs some basic quality control on the outputs.

It is designed to help run the artic bioinformatics protocols; for example the MEV protocol.

## Features include:

- read filtering
- primer trimming
- amplicon coverage normalisation
- variant calling
- consensus building
- QC report generation

## Using amplicon-nf

We have produced a detailed SOP for running the pipeline using the EPI2MElabs desktop client which is [available here](/resources/amplicon-nf/amplicon-nf-epi2me-sop.html).
