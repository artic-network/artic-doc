[Fieldbioinformatics](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics) is a python based pipeline which takes read FASTQs generated by during viral amplicon sequencing and assembles them into a FASTA consensus sequence. 

## Features include:

- read filtering
- primer trimming
- amplicon coverage normalisation
- variant calling
- consensus building

## History

The analytical approach Fieldbioinformatics utilises was first developed to analyse Ebola virus sequencing data during [the 2014-16 West African Ebola outbreak](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4817224/), it was then developed into a dedicated automatic pipeline as part of the [ZIBRA project](https://github.com/zibraproject/zika-pipeline) to do genomic surveillance of the Zika virus outbreak.

## Usage

Fieldbioinformatics is a single-sample, Nanopore specific, pipeline meaning that it can only be used to run a single sample at a time and only using data generated by nanopore sequencing. If you are interested in running multiple samples simultaneously or have Illumina data, then we recommend [amplicon-nf](/resources/amplicon-nf) which is a Nextflow pipeline far better suited to this usecase.
