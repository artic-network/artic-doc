## Description

artic-network/amplicon-nf is a bioinformatics pipeline that takes sequencing reads generated from ARTIC-style viral amplicon sequencing schemes, assembles them into consensus sequences, and runs some basic quality control on the outputs.

Full documentation for running the pipeline on the command-line [is available in the github repository](https://github.com/artic-network/amplicon-nf/tree/main/docs), however, if you prefer to utilise a GUI, we have SOPs for running the pipeline using [EPI2ME](https://epi2me.nanoporetech.com/) available below.
