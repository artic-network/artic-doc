## Primer Design and Amplicon Strategy

The Artic Network has recently developed the “artic-measles/400/v1.0.0” primer scheme, designed to account for all variation present across all MeV genotypes (with a focus on circulating strains) allowing for the scheme to be used for unknown (clinical samples) or mixed (environmental surveillance) samples. 
This scheme also utilises 400bp amplicons, providing very high sensitivity enabling a range of use cases, while also being compatible with the capacity built in public health from the 400bp `artic-sars-cov-2` schemes. 
Use of universal primer sets (e.g., WHO reference protocols).
