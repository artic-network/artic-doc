As part of the Wellcome Trust funded ARTIC 2 project we have developed a collection of measles virus resources that are now openly available at [artic.network/viruses/mev](https://artic.network/viruses/mev). These resources provide guidance for public health and research labs who are planning to perform genome sequencing and analysis of measles virus. We have assembled an end‑to‑end package including primers and sequencing resources, best practice pipelines for sequence data processing, and guidance for analysis and interpretation.
